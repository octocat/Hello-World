## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers manage and track changes in their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
It is used for:
* Tracking code changes
* Tracking who made changes
* Coding collaboration

## Some terminologies used in git.

### 1. Repository (Repo):
A repository is a folder or storage space where your project resides. It contains all the files, commit history, and configuration information.

### 2. Clone:
Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on the code locally and contribute changes back to the remote repository.

### 3. Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. It represents a set of changes you have made to your files.

### 4. Branch:
A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other.

### 5. Merge:
Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch. It is often used to integrate feature branches back into the main branch.

### 6. Pull Request (PR):
In Git repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab, a pull request is a way to propose changes to the codebase. It allows others to review and discuss the changes before they are merged.

### 7. Push:
Pushing is the process of uploading your local changes to a remote repository. This makes your changes accessible to others and updates the remote repository.

### 8.Fetch:
Fetching is the process of downloading changes from a remote repository to your local machine. It doesn't automatically merge the changes into your working branch; it only updates your local view of the remote repository.

### 9. Pull:
Pulling is a combination of fetching and merging. It downloads changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your working branch.

### 10. Merge Conflict:

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. Developers need to resolve conflicts manually by choosing which changes to keep.
